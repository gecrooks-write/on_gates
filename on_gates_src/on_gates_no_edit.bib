@Article{	  abrams2020a,
  abstract	= {Near-term applications of quantum information processors
		  will rely on optimized circuit implementations to minimize
		  the circuit depth, reducing the negative impact of gate
		  errors in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
		  computers. One approach to minimize the circuit depth is
		  the use of a more expressive gate set. The XY two-qubit
		  gate set can offer reductions in circuit depth for generic
		  circuits, as well as improved performance for problems with
		  symmetries that match the gate set. Here we report an
		  implementation of the family of XY entangling gates in a
		  transmon-based superconducting qubit architecture using a
		  gate decomposition strategy that requires only a single
		  calibrated pulse. The approach allows us to implement XY
		  gates with a median fidelity of 97.35 $\pm$0.17{\%},
		  approaching the coherence-limited gate fidelity of the
		  two-qubit pair. We also show that the XY gate can be used
		  to implement instances of the quantum approximate
		  optimization algorithm, achieving a reduction in circuit
		  depth of \~{}30{\%} compared with the use of CZ gates only.
		  Finally, we extend our decomposition scheme to other gate
		  families, which can allow for further reductions in circuit
		  depth.},

  abstract	= {The variational quantum eigensolver is one of the most
		  promising approaches for performing chemistry simulations
		  using noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors.
		  The efficiency of this algorithm depends crucially on the
		  ability to prepare multi-qubit trial states on the quantum
		  processor that either include, or at least closely
		  approximate, the actual energy eigenstates of the problem
		  being simulated while avoiding states that have little
		  overlap with them. Symmetries play a central role in
		  determining the best trial states. Here, we present
		  efficient state preparation circuits that respect particle
		  number, total spin, spin projection, and time-reversal
		  symmetries. These circuits contain the minimal number of
		  variational parameters needed to fully span the appropriate
		  symmetry subspace dictated by the chemistry problem while
		  avoiding all irrelevant sectors of Hilbert space. We show
		  how to construct these circuits for arbitrary numbers of
		  orbitals, electrons, and spin quantum numbers, and we
		  provide explicit decompositions and gate counts in terms of
		  standard gate sets in each case. We test our circuits in
		  quantum simulations of the
		  {\$}{\$}{\{}H{\}}{\_}{\{}2{\}}{\$}{\$}and
		  {\$}{\$}LiH{\$}{\$}molecules and find that they outperform
		  standard state preparation methods in terms of both
		  accuracy and circuit depth.},

  abstract	= {Faster algorithms for combinatorial optimization could
		  prove transformative for diverse areas such as logistics,
		  finance and machine learning. Accordingly, the possibility
		  of quantum enhanced optimization has driven much interest
		  in quantum technologies. Here we demonstrate the
		  application of the Google Sycamore superconducting qubit
		  quantum processor to combinatorial optimization problems
		  with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA).
		  Like past QAOA experiments, we study performance for
		  problems defined on the planar connectivity graph native to
		  our hardware; however, we also apply the QAOA to the
		  Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model and MaxCut, non-native
		  problems that require extensive compilation to implement.
		  For hardware-native problems, which are classically
		  efficient to solve on average, we obtain an approximation
		  ratio that is independent of problem size and observe that
		  performance increases with circuit depth. For problems
		  requiring compilation, performance decreases with problem
		  size. Circuits involving several thousand gates still
		  present an advantage over random guessing but not over some
		  efficient classical algorithms. Our results suggest that it
		  will be challenging to scale near-term implementations of
		  the QAOA for problems on non-native graphs. As these graphs
		  are closer to real-world instances, we suggest more
		  emphasis should be placed on such problems when using the

  abstract	= {Quantum computers are an emerging technology promising to
		  be vastly more powerful at solving certain problems than
		  any conventional computer. These devices are now moving out
		  of the laboratory and becoming generally programmable. This
		  allows identical quantum tasks or algorithms to be
		  implemented on radically different technologies to inform
		  further development and scaling. We run a series of
		  algorithms on the two leading platforms: trapped atomic
		  ions and superconducting circuits. Whereas the
		  superconducting system offers faster gate clock speeds and
		  a solid-state platform, the ion-trap system features
		  superior qubits and reconfigurable connections. The
		  performance of these systems is seen to reflect the
		  topology of connections in the base hardware, supporting
		  the idea that quantum computer applications and hardware
		  should be codesigned.We run a selection of algorithms on
		  two state-of-the-art 5-qubit quantum computers that are
		  based on different technology platforms. One is a publicly
		  accessible superconducting transmon device
		  (www.research.ibm.com/ibm-q) with limited connectivity, and
		  the other is a fully connected trapped-ion system. Even
		  though the two systems have different native quantum
		  interactions, both can be programed in a way that is blind
		  to the underlying hardware, thus allowing a comparison of
		  identical quantum algorithms between different physical
		  systems. We show that quantum algorithms and circuits that
		  use more connectivity clearly benefit from a
		  better-connected system of qubits. Although the quantum
		  systems here are not yet large enough to eclipse classical
		  computers, this experiment exposes critical factors of
		  scaling quantum computers, such as qubit connectivity and
		  gate expressivity. In addition, the results suggest that
		  codesigning particular quantum applications with the
		  hardware itself will be paramount in successfully using
		  quantum computers in the future.},

		  algorithms. Several trends in scientific computing suggest
		  that this important matrix operation will have an
		  increasingly greater role to play in the future. First, the

		  thriving. These include signal processing, image
		  processing, semidefinite programming, and quantum
		  computing. Second, sparse factorizations and Kronecker
		  products are proving to be a very effective way to look at
		  fast linear transforms. Researchers have taken the
		  Kronecker methodology as developed for the fast Fourier
		  transform and used it to build exciting alternatives.
		  Third, as computers get more powerful, researchers are more
		  willing to entertain problems of high dimension and this
		  leads to Kronecker products whenever low-dimension
		  techniques are ``tensored'' together.},
